  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div  class="about-me">
        <img src="computerprogrammer_collaborating.jfif">
        <p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
        <small>In Feburary of 2020 I began taking courses at devCodeCamp. 
          The agenda was fully immersive where we were were taught how to become full stack web developers.
        The languages taught were C#, JS, SQL, and ASP.net to name a few.
         The content given was foundationally formated to promote continued success, both in and outside the
          class room, via the given various real world problems and team driven solutions.</small>

    <div  class="about-me">
      <img src="success.jfif">
      <p><b>CAREER PATH</b></p>
      <small>It was a long hard fought road before I decided it was time to pursue my passion as a Software Developer! 
        I started as a machine operator on a corrugator, then a Heavy Equipment Operator in the military, followed by a CNC machinist programmer,
      and last a carpenter.  At each postion I reached my highest possible potential as there was no higher to go. In one instance I was even offered
      to be a supervisor in a relatively short period of time. Since money was never my top priority Feeling unfullied I decided I wanted greater challenges 
      and a means to constantly learn something new while achieving new heights, goals, and perspectives. That is when I decided Software Development was 
      the only means to attain such a feat!  </small>

  <div  class="about-me">
    <img src="family.png">
    <p><b>FAMILY</b></p>
    <small>Throughout my career path my wife Emeli and 3 children have been the reason I continue to push myself to reach my highest potential,
      not only in the work force but as a human being! There's nothing quite like being a father and learning things good and bad about yourself
      and finding new ways to teach your kids and others to be better than you. I've found that charity is the best way to do that. We try to reach
      out to the homeless community and just talking to them to meet some of their most basic needs whenever possible. They really give me perspective in life 
      and appreciation for the small things. The less fortunate is a big reason I joined this field, since its all about a problem solving mindset, 
      homelessness is no doubt a huge problem especially here in the inner city. A side project for me will be to create a homeless app that gives 
      real time data to that community linking various communal resources in one place to help meet their daily provisional needs.

<h2>PROJECTS</h2>

    <p>Below are links to some of the various projects I've done while at devCodeCamp.</p>

          <p><b>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</b>-A game based on its title with two added features that required us to take our logic up another level.</p>

              <p><b>Custom List Project</b>-A project where we replicated various methods, operators, and generic classes already written into C# and tested them using TDD.</p>
